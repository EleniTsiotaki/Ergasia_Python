# Python Assignments

**University Coursework Repository** – contains Python programs from assignments.

## 📘 Overview

This repository includes **four Python scripts**, each solving a different problem: file processing, Fibonacci numbers & primality, API data fetching, and a random SOS game simulation.

## 📂 Files

### `12.py` – ASCII File Processing

* Reads a text file given by the user.
* Reverses words and their characters.
* Creates a “mirror” transformation of the text using ASCII codes.

### `2.py` – Fibonacci & Primality Check

* Computes the *n*-th Fibonacci number.
* Tests if it is prime using Fermat’s primality test (20 iterations).
* Prints whether the number is prime or not.

### `3.py` – OPAP Lottery Results (API)

* Fetches lottery draw results from the **OPAP API**.
* Iterates from the start of the month to the current day.
* Prints the first winning draw of each day.

### `5.py` – SOS Game Simulation

* Asks user for rectangle dimensions.
* Fills a grid randomly with "S" and "O".
* Counts horizontal, vertical, and diagonal "SOS" patterns.
* Repeats 100 times and calculates the average number of “SOS” found.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **Libraries Used:**

  * `random`, `math`, `datetime`, `urllib`, `json`

## ▶️ Usage

Run any script with:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Example:

```bash
python 2.py
```

Each script runs independently and prompts user input or prints results.
